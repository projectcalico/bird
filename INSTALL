How to install BIRD
===================

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Default location for configuration file is /usr/local/etc/bird.conf and
for control socket is /usr/local/var/run/bird.ctl . You can change that
by --prefix, --sysconfdir and --runstatedir configure options, e.g.:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --runstatedir=/run

To compile current development BIRD source code from Git repository, you
also need Git (to download the source code) and Autoconf (to generate
the configure script and associated files using 'autoreconf' tool):

$ git clone https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/bird/
$ cd bird
$ autoreconf

Then continue as in usual installation above.


Requirements
============

For compiling BIRD you need these programs and libraries:

 - GNU C Compiler (or LLVM Clang)
 - GNU Make
 - GNU Bison
 - GNU M4
 - Flex

 - ncurses library
 - GNU Readline library

For compiling BIRD documentation you also need:

 - Linuxdoc-Tools
 - LaTeX

Note that build scripts for BIRD documentation expects 'nsgmls' from
James Clark's SP suite, while modern distributions use 'onsgmls' from
OpenSP suite. It is possible to build BIRD documentation with OpenSP
tools, but it requires manually tweaking paths in doc/sgml2* scripts.
